Thanks for installing Oauth-mail, a light-weighted email agent for sublime txt.

Currently, oauth-mail supports Microsoft outlook.com (including hotmail, livemail, etc.) and gmail **and most of standard IMAP/SMTP mail servers**.

OauthMail supports two authentication methods: oauth authentication and password authentication.

The setting template is

Preference -> Package Settings -> Oauth Mail -> Mail settings - Default

 you should copy it and paste to

Preference -> Package Settings -> Oauth Mail -> Mail settings - User

to configure your own mail settings.

Please have a look at README.md for more details.
